- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
- Neural Network (Keras Sequential)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 📄 Dataset

- Format: CSV
- Contains categorical and numerical features
- Target: A categorical label (e.g., binary or multiclass)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open `Classification_Task.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2. Run all cells to view preprocessing, model performance, and analysis
