# 🔢 Regression Task – AI/ML Portfolio

## 🧠 Task Overview

This notebook tackles a regression problem using multiple machine learning models to predict a continuous target variable. The aim is to compare different approaches and evaluate their performance using standard regression metrics.

## 🧰 Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Neural Network (Keras Sequential)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

## 📄 Dataset

- Format: CSV
- Includes both numerical and categorical features (with preprocessing as needed)
- Target: A continuous variable (e.g., price, rating, or score)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open `regression_models.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2. Run all cells to view data prep, model training, and evaluation
