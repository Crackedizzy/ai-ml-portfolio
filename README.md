# 🧠 AI & ML Portfolio – Regression and Classification Projects

This repository contains two core machine learning tasks developed for my university module *Concepts and Technologies of AI*. Each task applies multiple ML models to solve a real-world problem, using different datasets.

📁 Explore the folders below for full notebooks, datasets, and model comparisons.

## 🔢 Regression Task

- Predicting a continuous outcome using models like:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Neural Network (Keras)
- Includes performance evaluation (MSE, RMSE, R²)

📂 [`regression-task/`](./regression-task)

## 🧮 Classification Task

- Classifying categorical outcomes using:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Neural Network (Keras)
- Includes confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score

📂 [`classification-task/`](./classification-task)
